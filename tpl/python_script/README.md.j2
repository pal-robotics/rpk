====================

Welcome to your new robot application!

What are the next steps?

## Customize your application

By default, the template does not do anything useful. However, it demonstrates how to use *intents* to trigger behaviours or react to events.

*Intents* are usually generated by your robot's users. It can happen:
- through automatic perception (eg, someone approaches and seems to interact),
- through verbal interaction (eg, someone tells the robot to go somewhere)
- through interactions with the touchscreen (eg, someone presses a button to trigger a behaviour).

Your application template already contains examples of each of these possible interactions.

## Install on the robot

To install you app on the robot, you need to:

1. `pal_deploy`
2. manually install each of the webpages using the robot's *touchscreen manager* GUI
3. create a symbolic link to add you chatbot
4. re-train the chatbot engine with your chatbot
