====================

Welcome to your new robot application!

What are the next steps?

## Customize your application

By default, the template does not do anything useful. However, it demonstrates how to use *intents* to trigger behaviours or react to events.

*Intents* are usually generated by your robot's users. It can happen:
- through automatic perception (eg, someone approaches and seems to interact),
- through verbal interaction (eg, someone tells the robot to go somewhere)
- through interactions with the touchscreen (eg, someone presses a button to trigger a behaviour).

Your application template already contains examples of each of these possible interactions.

## Install on the robot

To install you app on the robot, you need to follow the 3 following steps:

1. `pal_deploy` your code to the robot
2. enable the chatbot (if you are using one)
3. install the webpages (if you are using any)

### Deploy the application controller to the robot

**To deploy the code to the robot, you *must* be running the following commands form within your Developer SDK Docker image!**

- from inside your Developer SDK Docker image, go to root of the project
- run `rosrun pal_deploy deploy.py --package {{ id }} ari-XXc` (replace `ari-XXc` by your actual robot)

You can now `ssh` onto the robot (`ssh pal@ari-XXc`, password `pal`), and go to your project: `cd ~/deployed_ws/share/{{ id }}`

### Enable the chatbot

To enable your chatbot, follow the following steps *on the robot*:

```
cd ~/.pal/chatbots-enabled
```

Then, for each language you support (here, for instance `en_US`):

```
ln -s ~/deployed_ws/share/{{ id }}/chatbot/en_US en_US/{{ id }}
```

Finally, you must re-train the chatbot engine for each new language:

```
rostopic pub /train_chatbot/goal chatbot_msgs/ChatbotTrainActionGoal "header:
  seq: 0
  stamp:
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0
  frame_id: ''
goal_id:
  stamp:
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0
  id: ''
goal:
  lang: 'en_US'"
```

**Note: you need to re-train the chatbot engine after every modification to the chatbot definition.**

### Install the webpages

To install your webpages onto the robot, check `pages/README.md`.

## Run your application

`ssh` onto the robot (`ssh pal@ari-XXc`, password `pal`), and start your application: `rosrun {{ id }} run_app`

### Configure for automatic launch at start-up

You can also configure your app to automatically start when the robot is turned on.

- create and edit a file called `~/.pal/pal_startup/config`
